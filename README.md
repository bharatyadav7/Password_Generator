Using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I learned how to create this web application. A clear and user-friendly interface will greet you when you arrive at the website. All you have to do is click the "Generate Password" button. Instantaneously, a secure, random password will be generated. You can choose the length of the password and even add numbers, capital letters, and lowercase letters.
